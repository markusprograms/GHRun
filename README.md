# GHRun
[GHRun](https://ghrun.markus1234.repl.co/) is a tool to run Github repositories online without downloading any files. <br>
Any user can run any repository even when the user doesn't own it. <br>
This tool can be used as a simple webhosting. 

## How to run a repository
 - **Standart method**: 
    1. Visit the website, [https://ghrun.markus1234.repl.co/](https://ghrun.markus1234.repl.co/)
    2. In the `repository name` field put the name of the repository that you want to run. 
    3. Write author or organization that owns the repository in the second input field. 
    4. Don't forget to select a branch to run. 
    5. The last field is name of the file, that will be evaluated. For example, if you want to run a website, where the `index.html` file is in folder `public`, you put there `public/index.html`. 
    6. Wait until the server set up the repository. 
    7. Enjoy the program!

 - **Absolute links**: <br>
    To get a link to run a repository, replace this with your data: <br>
    https://ghrun.markus1234.repl.co/run/REPOSITORY/AUTHOR/BRANCH/FILE<br>
    <br>
    The **FILE** is name of the file that will be evaluated. It can be for example `public/scripts/index.html`<br>
<br>
Once you request running a repository, the server will chache it for some time, so when you run the same repository again, you won't have to wait.
